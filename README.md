VG-V2

This is a heavy modded version of Shopify Dawn V2, so copyright, licenses blah blah blah to them for the original code.

As much as I love the new Shopify V2 theme way of doing things to allow store owners the ablility to change everything, my clients would basically break their layouts as they like to push loads of buttons without knowing what they do, or remember what they had pressed.  Due to this the settings that can be edited in the admin for the theme has been some what limited, unless they want to play with the actual code editor, and then if they break that lease its a simple code copy and paste to fix any issues.

Like always any comments, questions, suggestions etc let me know, Andy
